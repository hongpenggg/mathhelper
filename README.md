# mathhelper
A math helper tool (IDK why)

Now, look here. This is a tool with some simple tools inside it. 

There are:
  1. Simple tools, +-x÷
  2. More complex ones, like √(x).
  3. Stat Analysis tools, like mean, median, mode and standard deviation (stddev).
 
 All these are simply for lazy people like you and I, all whom simply don't want to move to grab a calculator.
 
 Although, I highly suspect that the time I spent coding this is probably more than a lifetime of time spent on grabbing a calculator from somewhere.
 
 *Note: I got slightly lazy towards the end, so I reused some local variable names, and used some unintuitive but short var names. Don't mind me.*
 
 Written in Python.
 
 
 TL;DR:
It's just a calculator, folks. >:)
