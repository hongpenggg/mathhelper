# mathhelper
A math helper tool (IDK why)

Now, look here. This is a tool with some simple tools inside it. 

There are:
  1. Simple tools, +-x÷
  2. More complex ones, like √(x).
  3. Stat Analysis tools, like mean, median, mode and standard deviation (stddev). [I was hoping to add the linreg ability to this but I'm a little lazy to do it.]
 
 All these are simply for lazy people like you and I, all whom simply don't want to move to grab a calculator.
 
 Although, I highly suspect that the time I spent coding this is probably more than a lifetime of time spent on grabbing a calculator from somewhere.
 
 *Note: I got slightly lazy towards the end, so I reused some local variable names, and used some unintuitive but short var names. Don't mind me.*
 
 Written in Python.
 
 
 TL;DR:
It's just a calculator, folks. >:)
